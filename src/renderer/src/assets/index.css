  We are creating a new rule for the 'body' element.
  @layer base tells Tailwind to treat this as a fundamental base style.
  @apply lets us use Tailwind's utility classes directly in our CSS.
  
  This sets a light gray background in light mode and a dark slate background
  in dark mode for the ENTIRE application window. It also sets default text colors.
